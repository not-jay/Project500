Project 500 is an advocacy to help revive the forests of Cebu, one tree at a time.

## Background
The disastrous onslaught of Typhoon Yolanda left thousands of people homeless and vast areas of land barren. One of these areas are the coasts of the island of Bantayan in the province of Cebu.

In line with this, the USC Computer Engineering undergraduate students enrolled in the Project Management class (42E) under the advisory of Engr. Christine Marie Gohetia is organizing Project 500, a mangrove planting activity in the mangrove forests of the Obo-ob Mangrove Garden Integrated Ecotourism and Conservation Association (OMAGIECA). This project aims to rehabilitate typhoon-devastated areas by planting 5000 mangrove seedlings. The project will be conducted on April 4, 2014 to April 5, 2014 (Friday and Saturday). 

Thus, we are inviting anyone/any company to be one of the sponsors of the project to help finance and contribute to its success.
