#[USC Project 500](https://www.facebook.com/USCProject500)

Project 500 is an advocacy to help revive the forests of Cebu, one tree at a time.

## Background
The disastrous onslaught of Typhoon Yolanda left thousands of people homeless and vast areas of land barren. One of these areas are the coasts of the island of Bantayan in the province of Cebu.

In line with this, the USC Computer Engineering undergraduate students enrolled in the Project Management class (42E) under the advisory of Engr. Christine Marie Gohetia is organizing Project 500, a mangrove planting activity in the mangrove forests of the Obo-ob Mangrove Garden Integrated Ecotourism and Conservation Association (OMAGIECA). This project aims to rehabilitate typhoon-devastated areas by planting 5000 mangrove seedlings. The project will be conducted on April 4, 2014 to April 5, 2014 (Friday and Saturday). 

Thus, we are inviting anyone/any company to be one of the sponsors of the project to help finance and contribute to its success.

- [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) - The platform for running most of the automation tools
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) - We use SASS for CSS, so this one's an additional
- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) - Takes care of the dependencies you'll ever need for building

Then fork this repo, and clone your fork  of it locally. Then `cd` to the cloned directory and run these one after the other:


```
npm install
bower install

```

The last one should run a server, and open the browser. And you're good to go! Development files should be in the `apps` directory. If you're ready to send back changes, just do a commit, push to your fork and request a pull.
